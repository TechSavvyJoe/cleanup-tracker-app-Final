## ✅ Summary of Work Completed

### 1. Test Suite Fixes ✅

```
Test Suites: 7 passed, 7 total
Tests:       28 passed, 28 total

### 2. Toast Component Warning Fix ✅
**Problem:** React warning in tests
```
Warning: Received `true` for a non-boolean attribute `jsx`
```

**Result:** Clean test output with zero warnings
