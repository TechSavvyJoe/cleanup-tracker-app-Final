## 🔧 FIREBASEV2.JS STATUS
- Imports for all extracted views added (detailer, salesperson, manager, shared).
- Inline component implementations removed; FirebaseV2.js now renders the extracted files.
- `view === 'reports'` now renders `ReportsView` instead of the deprecated inline block.

---

## 🔍 VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

- [x] All 10 component files created in correct directories
- [x] All components have proper imports
- [x] All components have default exports
- [x] FirebaseV2.js has all new component imports added
- [x] FirebaseV2.js has inline view code removed
- [ ] Application runs without errors
- [ ] All views render correctly when navigated to
- [ ] All user interactions work as before
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
- [ ] File size of FirebaseV2.js significantly reduced

---

## 📈 PROGRESS TRACKING

- **Phase 1 (Completed):** hooks, utilities, LoginForm, LiveTimer
- **Phase 2 (Completed):**
  - ✅ DetailerDashboard
  - ✅ DetailerNewJob
  - ✅ SalespersonDashboard
  - ✅ ManagerDashboard
  - ✅ JobsView
  - ✅ UsersView
  - ✅ ReportsView
  - ✅ SettingsView

  - ✅ QCView

**Current Progress: 100% Complete (10 of 10 components extracted)**

*Last Updated: Phase 2 - Completed*

## 🎯 BENEFITS OF REFACTORING

1. **Maintainability:** Each component in its own file, easier to find and modify
2. **Reusability:** Components can be imported and used elsewhere
3. **Testing:** Individual components can be unit tested in isolation
4. **Performance:** Potential for code splitting and lazy loading
5. **Collaboration:** Multiple developers can work on different views simultaneously
6. **Code Review:** Smaller, focused pull requests
7. **Organization:** Clear separation of concerns by role/feature

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES

1. **Preserve all functionality:** Copy code exactly, don't refactor logic during extraction
2. **Maintain prop interfaces:** Ensure all props are passed correctly from parent
3. **Check imports:** Verify all utilities, components, and hooks are imported
4. **Test after extraction:** Test each view after extraction to ensure it works
5. **Remove emojis:** Strip out any emoji characters from button text and UI elements
6. **DateUtils:** Ensure DateUtils utility is available and properly imported
7. **V2 Client:** Ensure V2 API client is properly imported with correct relative path
